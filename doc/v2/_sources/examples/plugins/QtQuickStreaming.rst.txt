Manage Qt Quick applications for WebGL Streaming
================================================

This script plugin creates a convenience UI that lets you start and stop Qt Quick applications
with WebGL streaming enabled.

The script plugin is destroyed when VRED shuts down or when all script plugins 
are reloaded. When this happens, we want to stop all created processes again, to not 
leave orphan processes behind.
To do this, the function ``onDestroyVREDScriptPlugin()`` has been implemented. It is 
called automatically before the plugin is destroyed.

Each script plugin can (but is not required to) implement ``onDestroyVREDScriptPlugin()`` to 
do something just before the current instance of the plugin is destroyed.

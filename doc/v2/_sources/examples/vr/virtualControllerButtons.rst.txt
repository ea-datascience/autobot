Define and use virtual buttons on the touchpad of a VR controller 
=================================================================

This shows how to add five virtual buttons to a touchpad of a VR controller. One button will be in the
center and four buttons of same size will be placed around the center button. This example implements
a device interaction that contains five device actions for the press of each button. The connected methods
will print out which button has been pressed. Here, only the left controller is used. Note that
the interaction is part of an interaction group that only contains this interaction, which means that other
interactions are not available, when this interaction group is active.

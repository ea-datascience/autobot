Set the default teleport to a virtual button.
=============================================

This example shows how the default teleport can be remapped to a previously defined virtual touchpad button of the
VR controller. Further information of how virtual buttons can be added to the touchpad can be found in the
":ref:`virtual-controller-buttons`" example. After the touchpad is set up, the virtual buttons can be used for remapping.

When this example is executed, the default teleport will work as usual but only the lower quarter of the touchpad
will actually activate and execute the teleport. This way, other parts of the touchpad can be mapped to other interactions.

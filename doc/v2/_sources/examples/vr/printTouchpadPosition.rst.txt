.. _print-touchpad-position:

Print the current finger position on the touchpad 
=================================================

Shows how a device interaction can be implemented, that uses the touchpad of a VR controller. Further information
on how a custom interaction can be implemented is shown in the ":ref:`custom-interaction`" example.

This device interaction creates two device actions, which are triggered when the touchpad is touched, or when
the touch ends. When the touch starts, the moved signal of the controller is connected to a method that
prints the position of the finger on the touchpad. The information about the position is part of the
button state and can be queried from the device.

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:
  :lineno-start: 25  

  padPosition = device.getButtonState("Touchpad").getPosition()

The moved signal is disconnectd, when the touchpad is not touched anymore, which ends the printing of the position.

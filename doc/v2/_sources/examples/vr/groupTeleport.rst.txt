Extend the default teleport to multi user teleport
==================================================

This script implements group teleport functionality. It uses the default teleport interaction
and implements an additional group teleport interaction. How to combine default and custom interactions
can be seen in the ":ref:`combine-default-custom-interaction`" example.

When GroupTeleport is initialized, two virtual buttons are defined on the touchpad of a VR controller.
The upper half is one button and the lower half another. How virtual buttons work is shown in the ":ref:`virtual-controller-buttons`" example.

The actions of the default teleport are now mapped to the lower virtual button. Further information about
remapping the default interactions can also be found in the ":ref:`combine-default-custom-interaction`" example.

A new interaction is created for the group teleport. This handles the switching between the regular and
the group teleport, by using the upper button. If group teleport is active, all participants in the session will also be teleported to near the
target position.

After all signals are connected to their corresponding methods, the geometry positioning is set up by using a
parent constraint.

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:
  :lineno-start: 82  

  self.leftConstraint = vrConstraintService.createParentConstraint([self.leftController.getNode()], self.leftDisk, True)
  self.rightConstraint = vrConstraintService.createParentConstraint([self.rightController.getNode()], self.rightDisk, True)            

This geometry is positioned on top of the touchpad of the controller. It visualizes the current state.
The upper button will show "Single" if the regular teleport is active and "Group" if group teleport is active.
The buttons will be highlighted, when the user presses them. The setting of which geometry is visible is handled
in the corresponding methods.
The actual group teleport is done by syncing the camera node with all other users.

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:
  :lineno-start: 129

  cameraNode = vrCameraService.getActiveCamera()
  vrSessionService.syncNode(cameraNode)

For further information about syncing nodes refer to the ":ref:`collab-sync-example`" example.

Triggering the vibration functionality of a controller
======================================================

This example shows, how to call activate the vibration of a controller for a certain amount of time.
Some controllers have different axes, which can vibrate, but some controllers support only a single axis.
If this is the case the axis parameter will be ignored and can should be set to 0.

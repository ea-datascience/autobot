Connecting to a signal that is executed, when the controller collides with a node
=================================================================================

This example shows, how to connect to the signals that are triggered when a collision of the controller
starts or stops.
Controllers are only capable of detecting a collision, when either in hand mode or when using a Stylus
as input device. The tip of the index finger and the tip of the stylus contain the collision sensor.
Collisions are only detected when the colliding node supports collisions, which is currently limited to 
items in the VR menu, touch sensors and web engines.

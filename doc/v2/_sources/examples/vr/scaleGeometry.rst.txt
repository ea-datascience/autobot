Scale geometry in VR by using controllers
=========================================

This is the script that is part of the example scene ObjectScaling.vpb. The default pointer interaction is used
to implement the scaling. For this, the device actions of the pointer are connected to methods of the GeometryScaler
class. Further information of the connection to default interactions can be found in the example 
":ref:`connect-device-action-signal`".

A geometry can be selected with the ray of the pointer, by pressing the trigger completely down. Then a ray 
on the second controller is activated. Scaling is done by targeting the same object with the second controller
and also pressing the trigger completely down. When the controllers are moved, the scale of the geometry is adjusted.
The scaling can be stopped by releasing the trigger on one of the controllers or if one of the rays does
not intersect with the geometry anymore.

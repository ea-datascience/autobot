Trigger touch sensors with the hands 2
======================================

Touch sensors can be used with the hands out of the box. Only the geometry containing the touch sensors needs to be made interactible.
Open the touch sensor module to see the configuration.

This is a more complex variant of the example found :any:`here<VR-hands-touchsensor>`.

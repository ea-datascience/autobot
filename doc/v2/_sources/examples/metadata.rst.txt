Metadata example
=====================

VRED 2023.3 introduced support for managing metadata. 
However, previous versions already extracted metadata during CAD import for supported file types. 
It was added to the nodes as OpenSG ValuePair attachments. 

Also, API v1 allowed adding custom ValuePair attachments to nodes in the Scenegraph
with vrNodePtr.setAttribute.

This example demonstrates how to search for ValuePair attachments and how to convert them into metadata using the :class:`.vrMetadataService`.

Material groups
===============

When working with materials in the V2 API, it is important to understand the
difference between a material and a material node. A :doc:`/class_vrdMaterial` is not
derived from :doc:`/class_vrdNode`; therefore, it cannot appear in a :doc:`scenegraph</scenegraphs>`.

This is different from lights or cameras, which both derive from :doc:`/class_vrdNode`. This
difference is not directly visible in the UI. The Material Editor presents
materials in a hierarchical graph structure. But, this visual
representation does not reflect the true structure.

The Material Editor graph
holds :doc:`vrdMaterialNodes</class_vrdMaterialNode>`. These nodes hold the
real material.

To illustrate this, the next example creates a group and a :doc:`plastic
material </class_vrdPlasticMaterial>`, then moves the material under the
group. We could also create the group first and use it as the materialGroup
parameter in :ref:`createMaterial() <vredvrMaterialService.createMaterial(name, type, materialGroup)>`.


.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:
  :caption: Move a material under group

  # Create the material
  mat1 = vrMaterialService.createMaterial("plastic1", vrMaterialTypes.Plastic)

  # Create the group (it will automatically get a unique name, but we rename it afterwards)
  group1 = vrMaterialService.createMaterialGroup()
  group1.setName("matgroup")

  # Access the vrdMaterialNode that has been automatically created for the plastic material
  mat1Node = vrMaterialService.findMaterialNode(mat1)

  # Hierarchy modifications on vrdNodes are done by manipulating it's children class member
  group1.children.append(mat1Node)

  # Now the material will appear under the group. We can also move it back out to the top level
  vrMaterialService.getMaterialRoot().children.append(mat1Node)


Hierarchy operations on a group node can be performed by manipulating its :ref:`children<vredvrdNode.children>` class member. See also :doc:`vrdNodeList</class_vrdNodeList>` for further documentation.

Analog Clock example
====================

This example renders an analog clock with the current time. It shows an alternate way to update 
an application continually through a QTimer, instead of having to derive from vrAEBase and attaching
the script to VRED's application loop.
The QTimer serves essentially the same purpose. Since we do not specify an update interval, the timer
will trigger every time QT updates.

Apart from this, the new decoupled interface is used for finding nodes and updating the rotation of
vrdGeometryNodes.

When the script is running, the clock can be stopped with 'clock.stop()'. It can be restarted again with 'clock.start()' and completely reset with 'clock.reset()'.

Create texture coordinates for line geometries
==============================================

This script shows 

* how to use :class:`.vrdGeometryNode` for low level access to geometry data.
  See ``GeometryAccess`` class and ``createLineTexCoords`` method below.

* how to find :class:`.vrdGeometryNode` nodes in the Scenegraph based on a filter predicate, in this case to find only line geometries.
  See method ``findLineGeos``.

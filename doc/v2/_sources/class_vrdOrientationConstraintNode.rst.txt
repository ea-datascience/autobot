.. _vredvrdOrientationConstraintNode:
.. py:class:: vrdOrientationConstraintNode

(Inherits :py:class:`vrdConstraintNode`)

This class gives access to an orientation constraint object in VRED. An orientation constraint will synchronize the orientation of a source and a target. If there are multiple sources, the orientation is calculated as the weighted average value of it.

For managing constraints and code examples see     :any:`vrConstraintService <vredvrConstraintService>`.
